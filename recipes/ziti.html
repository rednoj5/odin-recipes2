    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To me this is the ultimate comfort food. The spiciness of the chicken is complemented by the smooth creaminess of
        the Alfredo sauce. Delicious with a nice glass of white wine.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package ziti pasta</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning, or to taste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 large green bell pepper, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 large red bell pepper, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced, divided</li>
        <li>6 medium Roma tomatoes, diced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1½ cups whole milk, or more to taste</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese, or more to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1½ cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat oil in a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Add chicken, Cajun seasoning, and salt. Saute until chicken is cooked through and beginning to caramelize, about 10 minutes. Add bell peppers, onion, and 1/2 of the garlic; cook until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Add tomatoes and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add remaining garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add flour; cook and stir for 1 minute. Slowly whisk in 1 1/2 cups milk and bring to a gentle boil. Stir in 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper. Add more Parmesan to thicken or more milk to thin to your liking.</li>
        <li>Add cooked pasta to the chicken mixture; toss to coat. Transfer to a deep casserole dish. Pour cheese sauce over the pasta mixture and top with mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden and bubbly, about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
